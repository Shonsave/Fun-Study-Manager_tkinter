# Fun-Study-Manager_tkinter
Ever felt bored while studying? Have you ever decided to study a lot, but ended up doing nothing? Have you ever studied for 5mins, then taken a 4 hour break?
But this application reminds you to get back to studies after taking a short break. 

This Desktop GUI application has been made with python3 and tkinter. 
It has a setup file for cx_Freeze already configured, so a simple console command can export it into an executable. 

This app reminds you to return to studies after taking some breaks. It doesn't let your breaks get too long, and make sure you study for some amount of time too!
It doesn't even let you get too stressed after a lot of studies, by reminding you to take breaks occasionally. 

This is just the inspiration you need to make sure you study, in a fun way!!!
